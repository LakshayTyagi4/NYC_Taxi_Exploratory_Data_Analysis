# 🚖 NYC Taxi Trip Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the New York City Yellow Taxi Trip dataset to understand travel patterns, demand hotspots, trip behavior, and spatial trends across NYC.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from large-scale taxi trip data using Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, and data visualization techniques.



## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze NYC taxi trip records  
- Understand trip volume across different zones  
- Study pickup & drop-off patterns  
- Identify high-demand areas  
- Perform geospatial analysis  
- Visualize trends using charts and maps

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- GeoPandas  
- Shapely  
- Jupyter Notebook  



## 📊 What This Project Does

This notebook walks through the complete data analysis pipeline:

### 1. Data Loading  
NYC taxi trip data and taxi zone shapefiles are loaded into the notebook.

### 2. Data Cleaning  
The data is cleaned by removing missing values, correcting data types, and filtering invalid records.

### 3. Feature Engineering  
Important columns such as pickup and drop-off locations are extracted, and trip counts per location are calculated.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis  
The busiest pickup and drop-off locations are identified to understand travel demand.

### 5. Geospatial Analysis  
Taxi trip data is merged with NYC taxi zones to visualize spatial patterns across the city.

### 6. Data Visualization  
Charts, graphs, and maps are used to present insights in an easy-to-understand format.



## 🌍 Key Insights

This project helps answer questions like:
- Which areas of NYC have the most taxi pickups?  
- Which zones receive the most drop-offs?  
- How is taxi demand distributed across the city?  
- Which locations act as major transportation hubs?
